# FFT-in-MATLb

This repository contains code to introduce the core functions and plotting methods when using fast fourier transforms for spectral analysis in 1D. 

The High Harmonic Generation Script uses Data from a numerical simulation conducted using EPOCH particle-in-cell (PIC) code. Documentation on EPOCH can be found in this repository: https://github.com/Warwick-Plasma/epoch

The sdf file contains the data used in the script. To open this file in MATLAB, you will need the download the GetDataSDF package from the repository above.
